# Spotify-Data-Project

The data and much of the metadata from the two Daily playlists have been saved as follows:

* Master table with the playlist information is saved in `track_df.csv`
* Some of the extra artist information is saved in `track_artists.csv`
* The audio analysis data for each song in either playlist is saved in `track_songs.csv`
